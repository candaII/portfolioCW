            <p> Drew and I were the two composers for this production. The two of us decided before the first production meeting to split up the work between us. To ensure that the overall composition would make sense, we sent our rough drafts back and forth as to have a clear communication of ideas throughout. Having a two week timeline to compose, this was the most efficient approach.</p>

            <p> Tech week is when we made the most critical changes to make it fit with the actions and timings of the production. We worked closely with the Sound Designer to ensure that the music and sound effects meshed well to create a consistent sound. We got feedback from the director </p>
