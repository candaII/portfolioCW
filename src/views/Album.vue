                <p class="">This is a solo concept album recounting my time at college. I wanted it to be special so I decided to tackle this project alone. I was the sole composer, musician, recording engineer, mix engineer, and mastering engineer for this entire project. It's formatted to be listened to all the way through and has a side A and side B. The split between the two is between track 5, Roots, and track 6, The Wall. This was my final senior project in my last semester before graduation</p>
